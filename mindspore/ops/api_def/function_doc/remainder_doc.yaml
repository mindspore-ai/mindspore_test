remainder:
  description: |
    remainder(input, other) -> Tensor
    
    Computes the remainder of `input` divided by `other` element-wise. The result has the same sign as the divisor and
    its absolute value is less than that of `other`.

    Supports broadcasting to a common shape and implicit type promotion.

    .. code:: python

        remainder(input, other) == input - input.div(other, rounding_mode="floor") * other

    Note:
        Complex inputs are not supported. At least one input need to be tensor, but not both are bool tensors.

    Args:
        input (Union[Tensor, numbers.Number, bool]): The dividend is a numbers.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is
            `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_ or
            `bool <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_.
        other (Union[Tensor, numbers.Number, bool]): The divisor is a numbers.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool when the dividend is a tensor.
            When the dividend is Scalar, the divisor must be a Tensor whose data type is number or bool.

    Returns:
        Tensor, with dtype promoted and shape broadcasted.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input` and `other` are not of types: (tensor, tensor), (tensor, number), (tensor, bool),
            (number, tensor) or (bool, tensor).
        ValueError: If `input` and `other` are not broadcastable.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, mint
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([-4.0, 5.0, 6.0]).astype(np.float32))
        >>> y = Tensor(np.array([3.0, 2.0, 3.0]).astype(np.float64))
        >>> output = mint.remainder(x, y)
        >>> print(output)
        [2.  1.  0.]
