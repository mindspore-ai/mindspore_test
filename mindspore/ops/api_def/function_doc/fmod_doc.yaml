remainder:
  description: |
    fmod(input, other) -> Tensor
    
    Computes the floating-point remainder of the division operation input/other.

    .. math::

        out = input - n * other

    Where :math:`n` is :math:`input/other` with its fractional part truncated.
    The returned value has the same sign as `input` and is less than `other` in magnitude.

    .. warning:
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the dividend.
        other (Union[Tensor, Number]): the divisor.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
        and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, mint
        >>> input = Tensor(np.array([-4., -3.5, 0, 3.5, 4]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = mint.fmod(input, 2.5)
        >>> print(output)
        [-1.5 -1.   0.   1.   1.5]
