div:
  description: |
    div(input, other, *, rounding_mode=None) -> Tensor

    Divides each element of the `input` by the corresponding element of the `other` .

    .. math::

        out_{i} = input_{i} / other_{i}

    .. note::
        - When the two inputs have different shapes, they must be able to broadcast to a common shape.
        - The two inputs can not be bool type at the same time,
          [True, Tensor(True), Tensor(np.array([True]))] are all considered bool type.
        - The two inputs comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types
          consistent.

    Args:
        input (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): The dividend.
        other (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): The divisor.

    Keyword Args:
        rounding_mode (str, optional): Type of rounding applied to the result. Default: ``None`` .
            Three types are defined as,

            - None: Default behavior, which is the same as true division in Python or `true_divide` in NumPy.

            - "floor": Rounds the division of the inputs down, which is the same as floor division in Python
              or `floor_divide` in NumPy.

            - "trunc": Rounds the division of the inputs towards zero, which is the same as C-style integer division.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
        and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input` and `other` is not one of the following: Tensor, Number, bool.
        ValueError: If `rounding_mode` value is not None, "floor" or "trunc".

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, mint
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> y = Tensor(np.array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = mint.div(x, y)
        >>> print(output)
        [0.25 0.4 0.5]
