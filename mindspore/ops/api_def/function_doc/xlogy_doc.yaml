xlogy:
  description: |
    xlogy(input, other) -> Tensor

    Computes the first input multiplied by the logarithm of second input element-wise.
    Returns zero when `input` is zero.

    .. math::

        out_i = input_{i}\log{other_{i}}

    Inputs of `input` and `other` comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types consistent.
    The inputs must be two tensors or one tensor and one scalar.
    When the inputs are two tensors, the shapes of them could be broadcast.

    Args:
        input (Union[Tensor, numbers.Number, bool]): The first input is a numbers.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is
            `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_ or
            `bool <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_.
        other (Union[Tensor, numbers.Number, bool]): The second input is a numbers.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool when the first input is a tensor.
            When the first input is Scalar, the second input must be a Tensor whose data type is number or bool.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
        and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input` and `other` is not a numbers.Number or a bool or a Tensor.
        ValueError: If `input` could not be broadcast to a tensor with shape of `other`.

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> input = Tensor(np.array([-5, 0, 4]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> other = Tensor(np.array([2, 2, 2]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = ops.xlogy(input, other)
        >>> print(output)
