        all_gather_matmul(input, x2, group, world_size, *, bias=None, gather_index=0, gather_output=True, comm_turn=0, trans_input=False, trans_x2=False) -> Tensor

        In the TP segmentation scenario, allgather and matmul are fused, and communication and computational pipelines
        are parallelized within the fusion operator.

        .. math::
            output = allgather(input)@x2

            gather\_out = allgather(input)

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The left matrix of matmul, the dtype supports float16 and bfloat16, the shape supports 2
                dimensions, and the data format supports ND.
            x2 (Tensor): The right matrix of matmul, the dtype needs to be consistent with ``input`` , the shape
                supports 2 dimensions, and the data format supports ND.
            group (str): Communication group name, can be created by ``create_group`` method, or use the default group
                ``mindspore.communication.GlobalComm.WORLD_COMM_GROUP``.
            world_size (int): The total number of ranks in the communication group, should be consistent with the number
                of devices actually running, supporting ``2`` , ``4`` , and ``8`` .

        Keyword Args:
            bias (Tensor, optional): Currently only ``None`` is supported. Default: ``None`` .
            gather_index (int, optional): Indicates the allgather operation object, ``0`` means gather ``input`` ,
                ``1`` means gather ``x2`` . Currently only ``0`` is supported. Default: ``0`` .
            gather_output (bool, optional): Indicates whether gather output is required. Default: ``True`` .
            comm_turn (int, optional): Indicates the granularity of communication between ranks. Currently only ``0``
                is supported. Default: ``0`` .
            trans_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether ``input`` is transposed. Currently only ``False`` is
                supported. Default: ``False`` .
            trans_x2 (bool, optional): Indicates whether ``x2`` is transposed. Default: ``False`` .

        Returns:
            - output (Tensor) - The result of allgather and matmul fusion calculations.
            - gather_out (Tensor) - The result of allgather. If gather_output is ``False`` , ``gather_out`` returns a
              tensor with shape 0.

        Note:
            - When using this interface, please ensure that the driver firmware package and CANN package are both the
              matching 8.0.RC2 version or a higher version, otherwise an error will be reported, such as BUS ERROR.
            - The shape of ``input`` is (m, k), the shape of ``x2`` is (k, n), k is required to be equal, and the value
              range of k is [256, 65535). The shape of ``output`` is (m * world_size, n), and the shape of
              ``gather_out`` is (m * world_size, k).
            - The common fusion operators in a model only support the same communication group.

        Raises:
            TypeError: Any arg is of wrong type.
            RuntimeError: The dtype of ``input`` or ``x2`` is neither float16 nor bfloat16.
            RuntimeError: The dtypes of ``input`` and ``x2`` are different.
            RuntimeError: The shape of ``input`` or ``x2`` is not two-dimensional.
            RuntimeError: The k axis of ``input`` shape and ``x2`` shape are not equal.
            RuntimeError: k is less than ``256`` or greater than or equal to ``65535`` .
            RuntimeError: ``bias`` is not None.
            RuntimeError: ``group`` does not exist.
            RuntimeError: ``world_size`` is inconsistent with the actual number of running cards.
            RuntimeError: ``world_size`` is not equal to ``2`` , ``4`` , or ``8`` .
            RuntimeError: ``gather_index`` is not ``0`` .
            RuntimeError: ``trans_input`` is ``True`` .

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            .. note::
                Before running the following examples, you need to configure the communication environment variables.

                For Ascend/GPU/CPU devices, it is recommended to use the msrun startup method without any third-party or
                configuration file dependencies. Please see the `msrun start up <https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/en/master/parallel/msrun_launcher.html>`_
                for more details.

                This example should be run with 2 devices.
