    log() -> Tensor

    Returns the natural logarithm of a tensor element-wise.

    .. math::
        y_i = \log_e(self_i)

    .. warning::
        If the input value of operator Log is within the range (0, 0.01] or [0.95, 1.05], the output accuracy may
        be affacted.

    .. note::
        The value of `self` must be greater than 0.

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same shape as the `self`.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 4.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = x.log()
        >>> print(output)
        [0.        0.6931472 1.3862944]
