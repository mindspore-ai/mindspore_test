    diag() -> Tensor

    For details, please refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.diag`.

    .. method:: Tensor.diag(diagonal=0) -> Tensor
        :noindex:

    If input is a vector (1-D tensor), then returns a 2-D square tensor with the elements of input as the diagonal.

    If input is a matrix (2-D tensor), then returns a 1-D tensor with the diagonal elements of input.

    The argument diagonal controls which diagonal to consider:

    - If `diagonal` = 0, it is the main diagonal.

    - If `diagonal` > 0, it is above the main diagonal.

    - If `diagonal` < 0, it is below the main diagonal.

    .. warning::
        - This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.
        - The graph mode and CPU/GPU backends do not support non-zero values for the diagonal parameter.

    Args:
        diagonal (int, optional): the diagonal to consider. Default: ``0``.

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same dtype as the `input`, its shape is up to `diagonal`:

        - If `input` shape is :math:`(x_0)`: then output shape is :math:`(x_0 + \left | diagonal \right | , x_0 + \left | diagonal \right | )` 2-D Tensor.

        - If `input` shape is :math:`(x_0, x_1)`: then output shape is main diagonal to move :math:`(\left | diagonal \right |)` elements remains elements' length 1-D Tensor.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If shape of `input` is not 1-D and 2-D.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> input = Tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]).astype('int32')
        >>> output = input.diag()
        >>> print(output)
        [[1 0 0 0]
         [0 2 0 0]
         [0 0 3 0]
         [0 0 0 4]]
