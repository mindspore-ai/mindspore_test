put_:
  description: |
    put_(index, source, accumulate=False) -> Tensor

    Copies the elements from source into the positions specified by index.
    index and source need to have the same number of elements, but not necessarily the same shape.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        index (LongTensor): the index to be operated in the tensor.
        source (Tensor): the tensor containing values to copy from.
        accumulate (bool, optional): whether to accumulate into self, default: ``False``.

    Returns:
        Tensor, with the same dtype and shape as the `input`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If dtype of `index` is not long type.
        TypeError: If `input` and `source` have different dtypes.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> src = Tensor([[4, 3, 5],[6, 7, 8]], ms.float32)
        >>> index = Tensor([1, 3], ms.int64)
        >>> source = Tensor([9, 10], ms.float32)
        >>> src.put_(index, source)
        >>> print(src)
        [[4. 9. 5.]
         [10. 7. 8.]]
