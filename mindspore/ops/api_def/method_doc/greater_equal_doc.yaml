greater_equal:
  description: |
    greater_equal(other) -> Tensor
    
    Computes the boolean value of :math:`self >= other` element-wise.

    Args:
        other (Union[Tensor, Number]): `other` should be a Number or Tensor with data type number or bool.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting, and the data type is bool.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> input = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> other = Tensor(np.array([1, 1, 4]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> output = input.greater_equal(other)
        >>> print(output)
        [True True False]
