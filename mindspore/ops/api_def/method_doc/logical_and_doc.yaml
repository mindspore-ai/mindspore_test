    logical_and(other) -> Tensor

    Computes the "logical AND" of two tensors element-wise.

    .. math::
        out_{i} = self_{i} \wedge other_{i}

    .. note::
        - Inputs of `self` and `other` comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types
          consistent.
        - When the `other` is bool, it could only be a constant.

    Inputs:
        - **other** (Union[Tensor, bool]) - A bool or a tensor whose data type can be implicitly converted to bool.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as that of `self` and `other` after broadcasting, and the data type is bool.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([True, False, True]), mindspore.bool_)
        >>> other = Tensor(np.array([True, True, False]), mindspore.bool_)
        >>> output = x.logical_and(other)
        >>> print(output)
        [ True False False]
        >>> x = Tensor(1, mindspore.bool_)
        >>> other = Tensor(0, mindspore.bool_)
        >>> output = x.logical_and(other)
        >>> print(output)
        False
