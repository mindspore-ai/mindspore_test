  description: |
    take(indices, axis=None, mode='clip') -> Tensor

    Takes elements from a tensor along an axis.

    Args:
        indices (Tensor): The indices with shape :math:`(Nj...)` of the values to extract.
        axis (int, optional): The axis over which to select values. By default,
            the flattened input tensor is used. Default: ``None`` .
        mode (str, optional): Support ``'raise'``, ``'wrap'``, ``'clip'``.

            - ``raise``: Raises an error;

            - ``wrap``: Wraps around;

            - ``clip``: Clips to the range. ``'clip'`` mode means that all indices that are
              too large are replaced by the index that addresses the last element
              along that axis. Note that this disables indexing with negative numbers.

            Default: ``'clip'`` .

    Returns:
        Tensor, the indexed result.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `axis` is out of range, or `mode` has values other than ('raise', 'wrap', 'clip').

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> a = Tensor(np.array([4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8]))
        >>> indices = Tensor(np.array([0, 1, 4]))
        >>> output = a.take(indices)
        >>> print(output)
        [4 3 6]

    .. method:: Tensor.take(index) -> Tensor
        :noindex:

    Select the self element at the given index.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        index (LongTensor): The index tensor of self tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same data type as index tensor.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the dtype of `index` is not long type.

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> input = Tensor([[4, 3, 5],[6, 7, 8]], ms.float32)
        >>> index = Tensor([0, 2, 5], ms.int64)
        >>> output = input.take(index)
        >>> print(output)
        [4, 5, 8]
