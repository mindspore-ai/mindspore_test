sqrt_:
  description: |
    sqrt_() -> Tensor

    Replace each element in the current Tensor `self` with its square root.

    .. note::
        When an element of `self` is negative, the result at that position depends on the platform.

        - Calculate the square root of its opposite number on Atlas training series.
        - Get ``NaN`` on other platforms, such as Atlas A2 training series.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    .. math::
        self_{i} =  \sqrt{self_{i}}

    Returns:
        Tensor, the modified `self` itself.

    Supported Platforms:
       ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 4.0, 9.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = x.sqrt_()
        >>> print(output)
        [1. 2. 3.]
