floor_divide_:
  description: |
    floor_divide_(other) -> Tensor

    Divides the self tensor by the other tensor element-wise and round down to the closest integer.

    .. math::
        out_{i} = \text{floor}( \frac{self_i}{other_i})

    where the :math:`floor` indicates the Floor operator. For more details,
    please refer to the :class:`mindspore.mint.Floor` operator.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Note:
        When `self` and `other` have different shapes, `other` should be able to broadcast to `self`.

    Args:
        other (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): The other input is a number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as `self` , and the data type is the same as `self` .

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `other` is not one of the following: Tensor, number.Number or bool.
        RuntimeError: If `other` cannot be broadcast to `self`.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([2, 4, -1]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> other = Tensor(np.array([3, 3, 3]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> output = x.floor_divide_(other)
        >>> print(output)
        [ 0  1 -1]
        >>> print(x)
        [ 0  1 -1]
