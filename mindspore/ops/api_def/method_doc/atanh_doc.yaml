atanh:
  description: |
    atanh(self) ->Tensor
    Computes inverse hyperbolic tangent of `self` element-wise.
    
    .. math::
    
    out_i = \tanh^{-1}(input_{i})
    
    Args:
      self (Tensor): The shape of tensor is
        :math:`(N,*)` where :math:`*` means, any number of additional dimensions.
    
    Returns:
      Tensor, has the same shape as `self`. The dtype of output is float32 when dtype of `self` is in [bool, int8, uint8, int16, int32, int64]. Otherwise output has the same dtype as `self`.
    
    Raises:
      TypeError: If `self` is not a Tensor.
    
    Supported Platforms:
      ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
    
    Examples:
      >>> import mindspore
      >>> import numpy as np
      >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
      >>> input = Tensor(np.array([0, -0.5]), mindspore.float32)
      >>> output = input.atanh()
      >>> print(output)
      [ 0.         -0.54930615]
