gcd:
  description: |
    gcd(other) -> Tensor

    Computes greatest common divisor of input tensors element-wise.
    The shape of two inputs should be broadcastable, and data types should be one of: int16 (supported when using the Ascend backend, GRAPH mode is only supported when the graph compilation level is O0), int32, int64.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        other (Tensor): The other input tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting, and the data type is one
        with higher precision in the two inputs.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If data type `self` or `other` is not int32 or int64.
        ValueError: If shapes of two inputs are not broadcastable.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> input = Tensor(np.array([7, 8, 9]))
        >>> other = Tensor(np.array([14, 6, 12]))
        >>> y = ops.gcd(input, other)
        >>> print(y)
        [7 2 3]
