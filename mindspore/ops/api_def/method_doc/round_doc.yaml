    round(decimals=0) -> Tensor

    Returns half to even of a tensor element-wise.

    .. math::
        out_i \approx self_i

    .. note::
        The self data types supported by the Ascend platform include 
        bfloat16 (Atlas training series products are not supported), float16, float32, float64, int32, and int64.

    Args:
        decimals (int, optional): Number of decimal places to round to (default: ``0``). If decimals is 
            negative, it specifies the number of positions to the left of the decimal point. It supports 
            converting the single-element tensor to an int.

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same shape and type as the `self`.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> input = Tensor(np.array([0.8, 1.5, 2.3, 2.5, -4.5]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = input.round()
        >>> print(output)
        [ 1.  2.  2.  2. -4.]
