remainder:
  description: |
    remainder(other) -> Tensor

    Computes the remainder of `self` divided by `other` element-wise. The result has the same sign as the divisor and
    its absolute value is less than that of `other`.

    Supports broadcasting to a common shape and implicit type promotion.

    .. code:: python

        remainder(input, other) == input - input.div(other, rounding_mode="floor") * other

    .. note::
        Complex inputs are not supported. At least one input need to be tensor, but not both are bool tensors.

        The dividend `self` is a tensor whose data type is
        `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_ or
        `bool <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_.

    Args:
        other (Union[Tensor, numbers.Number, bool]): The divisor is a numbers.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool when the dividend is a tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor, with dtype promoted and shape broadcasted.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `self` and `other` are not of types: (Tensor, Tensor), (Tensor, Number),
            (Tensor, bool), (Number, Tensor) or (bool, Tensor).
        ValueError: If `self` and `other` are not broadcastable.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([-4.0, 5.0, 6.0]).astype(np.float32))
        >>> y = Tensor(np.array([3.0, 2.0, 3.0]).astype(np.float64))
        >>> output = x.remainder(y)
        >>> print(output)
        [2.  1.  0.]

    .. method:: Tensor.remainder(divisor) -> Tensor
        :noindex:

    Computes the remainder of dividing the first input tensor by the second input tensor element-wise.

    Inputs of `self` and `divisor` comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types consistent.
    The inputs must be two tensors or one tensor and one scalar. When the inputs are two tensors,
    both dtypes cannot be bool, and the shapes of them could be broadcast. When the inputs are one tensor
    and one scalar, the scalar could only be a constant.

    .. code:: python

        remainder(input, other) == input - input.div(other, rounding_mode="floor") * other

    .. warning::
        - When the elements of input exceed 2048, there might be accuracy problems.
        - The calculation results of this operator on Ascend and CPU might be inconsistent.
        - If shape is expressed as (D1,D2... ,Dn), then D1\*D2... \*DN<=1000000,n<=8.

    .. note::
        The first input `self` is a tensor whose data type is number.

    Args:
        divisor (Union[Tensor, numbers.Number, bool]): When the first input is a tensor, The second input
            could be a number, a bool or a tensor whose data type is number.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
        and the data type is the one with higher precision.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If neither `self` nor `divisor` is one of the following: Tensor, Number, bool.
        ValueError: If the shape of `self` and `divisor` cannot be broadcasted to each other.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([-4.0, 5.0, 6.0]).astype(np.float16))
        >>> y = Tensor(np.array([3.0, 2.0, 3.0]).astype(np.float16))
        >>> output = x.remainder(divisor=y)
        >>> print(output)
        [2.  1.  0.]
