    view_as(other) -> Tensor

    View `self` Tensor as the same shape as `other` .

    Args:
        other(Tensor): The returned Tensor has the same shape as `other`.

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same shape as `other`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `other` is not a Tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> from mindspore import dtype as mstype
        >>> a = Tensor([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]], mstype.float32)
        >>> b = Tensor([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], mstype.float32)
        >>> output = a.view_as(b)
        >>> print(output)
        [1. 2. 3. 2. 3. 4.]
