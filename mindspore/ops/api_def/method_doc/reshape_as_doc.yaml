reshape_as:
    description: | 
        reshape_as(other) -> Tensor

        Change the shape of the Tensor to the shape of `other` without changing the data.

        Args:
            other (Tensor): The result tensor has the same shape as `other`.

        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same shape as `other`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore as ms
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> x = Tensor([[-0.1, 0.3, 3.6], [0.4, 0.5, -3.2]], dtype=ms.float32)
            >>> y = Tensor(np.arange(6).reshape(3,2))
            >>> output = x.reshape_as(y)
            >>> print(output)
            [[-0.1  0.3]
             [ 3.6  0.4]
             [ 0.5 -3.2]]
