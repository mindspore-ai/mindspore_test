    type_as(other) -> Tensor

    Returns self tensor cast to the type of the with the input other tensor.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Note:
        When converting complex numbers to boolean type, the imaginary part of the complex number is not
        taken into account. As long as the real part is non-zero, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

    Args:
        other (Tensor): The tensor whose data type is specified. The shape of tensor is :math:`(x_0, x_1, ..., x_R)`. 

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape of tensor is the same as `self`, :math:`(x_0, x_1, ..., x_R)`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `other` is not a Tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> input_np = np.random.randn(2, 3, 4, 5).astype(np.float32)
        >>> self = Tensor(input_np)
        >>> other_np = np.random.randn(2, 3, 4).astype(np.int32)
        >>> other = Tensor(other_np)
        >>> output = self.type_as(other)
        >>> print(output.dtype)
        Int32
        >>> print(output.shape)
        (2, 3, 4, 5)
