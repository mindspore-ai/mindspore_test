fmod:
  description: |
    fmod(other) -> Tensor
    
    Computes the floating-point remainder of the division operation self/other.

    .. math::

        out = self - n * other

    Where :math:`n` is :math:`self/other` with its fractional part truncated.
    The returned value has the same sign as `self` and is less than `other` in magnitude.

    Args:
        other (Union[Tensor, Number]): the divisor.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
        and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If neither `self` nor `other` is a Tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> input = Tensor(np.array([-4., -3.5, 0, 3.5, 4]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = input.fmod(2.5)
        >>> print(output)
        [-1.5 -1.   0.   1.   1.5]
