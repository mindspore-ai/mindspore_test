mul:
  description: |
    mul(other) -> Tensor
    
    Multiplies two tensors element-wise.
    
    .. math::
    
        out_{i} = tensor_{i} * other_{i}
    
    Note:
        - When `self` and `other` have different shapes,
          they must be able to broadcast to a common shape.
        - `self` and `other` can not be bool type at the same time,
          [True, Tensor(True, bool\_), Tensor(np.array([True]), bool\_)] are all considered bool type.
        - `self` and `other` comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types
          consistent.
    
    Args:
        other (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]): `other` is a number.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number.Number and bool.
    
    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
        and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among `self` and `other` .
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If `other` is not one of the following: Tensor, number.Number, bool.
        ValueError: If `self` and `other` are not the same shape.

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> y = Tensor(np.array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = x.mul(y)
        >>> print(output)
        [ 4. 10. 18.]
