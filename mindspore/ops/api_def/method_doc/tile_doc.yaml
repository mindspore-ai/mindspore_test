    tile(dims) -> Tensor

    Replicates an tensor with given dims times.

    Note:
        On Ascend, the number of `dims` should not exceed 8, and currently does not support scenarios
        where more than 4 dimensions are repeated simultaneously.

    Args:
        dims (tuple[int]): The parameter that specifies the number of replications,
            the parameter type is tuple, and the data type is int, i.e., :math:`(y_1, y_2, ..., y_S)`.
            Only constant value is allowed.

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same data type as the `self`. Suppose the length of `dims` is `d`,
        the dimension of `self` is `self.dim`, and the shape of `self` is :math:`(x_1, x_2, ..., x_S)`.

        - If `self.dim = d`, then the shape of their corresponding positions can be multiplied, and
          the shape of Outputs is :math:`(x_1*y_1, x_2*y_2, ..., x_S*y_S)`.
        - If `self.dim < d`, prepend 1 to the shape of `self` until their lengths are consistent.
          Such as set the shape of `self` as :math:`(1, ..., x_1, x_2, ..., x_S)`,
          then the shape of their corresponding positions can be multiplied, and the shape of Outputs is
          :math:`(1*y_1, ..., x_R*y_R, x_S*y_S)`.
        - If `self.dim > d`, prepend 1 to `dims` until their lengths are consistent. Such as set the
          `dims` as :math:`(1, ..., y_1, y_2, ..., y_S)`, then the shape of their corresponding positions
          can be multiplied, and the shape of Outputs is :math:`(x_1*1, ..., x_R*y_R, x_S*y_S)`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `dims` is not a tuple or not all elements are int.
        ValueError: If not all elements of `dims` are greater than or equal to 0.
