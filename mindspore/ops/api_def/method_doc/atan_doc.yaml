atan:
  description: |
    atan() -> Tensor
  
    Computes the trigonometric inverse tangent of `self` element-wise.

    .. math::
        out_i = \tan^{-1}(self_i)

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same shape as `self`. The dtype of output is float32 when dtype of `self` is in bool, int8, uint8, int16, int32, int64. Otherwise output has the same dtype as `self`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `self` is not a Tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 0.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = Tensor.atan(x)  # x.atan()
        >>> print(output)
        [0.7853982 0.       ]
