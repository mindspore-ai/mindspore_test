masked_scatter_:
    description: |
        masked_scatter_(mask, source) -> Tensor
        
        Updates the value in the `self` with the `source` value according to the `mask`, and returns a Tensor.
        The shape of `mask` and the `self` must be the same or `mask` is broadcastable.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            mask (Tensor[bool]): A bool tensor with a shape broadcastable to the `self`.
            source (Tensor): A tensor with the same data type as the `self`. The number
                of elements must be greater than or equal to the number of True's in `mask`.

        Returns:
            Tensor, with the same type and shape as the `self`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``
    
        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1., 2., 3., 4.]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> mask = Tensor(np.array([True, True, False, True]), mindspore.bool_)
            >>> tensor = Tensor(np.array([5., 6., 7.]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> output = x.masked_scatter_(mask, tensor)
            >>> print(output)
            [5. 6. 3. 7.]
            >>> print(x)
            [5. 6. 3. 7.]
