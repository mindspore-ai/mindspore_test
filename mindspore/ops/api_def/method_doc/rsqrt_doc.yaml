rsqrt:
  description: |
    rsqrt() -> Tensor

    Computes reciprocal of square root of self tensor element-wise.

    .. math::

        out_{i} =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{self_{i}}}

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same shape and dtype as the `self`.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> input = Tensor([-0.0370,  0.2970,  1.5420, -0.9105])
        >>> output = input.rsqrt()
        >>> print(output)
        [       nan 1.8349396  0.8053002        nan]
