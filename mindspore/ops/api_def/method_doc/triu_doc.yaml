triu:
  description: |
    triu(diagonal) -> Tensor
    
    Returns the upper triangle part of 'self' (elements that contain the diagonal and below),
    and set the other elements to zeros.
    
    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.
    
    Args:
        diagonal (int, optional): An optional attribute indicates the diagonal to consider, default: ``0`` ,
            indicating the main diagonal.
    
    Returns:
        Tensor, a tensor has the same shape and data type as `self`.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If `diagonal` is not an int.
        ValueError: If the dimension of `self` is less than 2.
    
    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
