inverse:
  description: |
    inverse() -> Tensor
    
    Compute the inverse of the `self` matrix.
    
    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same type and shape as `self`.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the last two dimensions of `self` are not the same size.
        ValueError: If the dimension of `self` is less than 2.
    
    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
    
    Examples:
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> from mindspore import dtype as mstype
        >>> x = Tensor([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]], mstype.float32)
        >>> print(x.inverse())
        [[-2.   1. ]
         [ 1.5 -0.5]]
