mean:
  description: |
    mean(dim=None, keepdim=False, *, dtype=None) -> Tensor
    
    Reduces all dimension of a tensor by averaging all elements in the dimension, by default.
    And reduce a dimension of `self` along the specified `dim`. `keepdim`
    determines whether the dimensions of the output and self are the same.
    
    Note:
        The `dim` with tensor type is only used for compatibility with older versions and is not recommended.
    
    Args:
        dim (Union[int, tuple(int), list(int), Tensor], optional): The dimensions to reduce. Default: ``None`` ,
            reduce all dimensions. Only constant value is allowed. Assume the rank of `self` is r,
            and the value range is [-r,r).
        keepdim (bool, optional): If ``True`` , keep these reduced dimensions and the length is 1.
            If ``False`` , don't keep these dimensions. Default: ``False`` .

    Keyword Args:
        dtype (:class:`mindspore.dtype`, optional): The desired data type of returned Tensor. Default: ``None`` .
    
    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same data type as self tensor.
    
        - If `dim` is ``None`` , and `keepdim` is ``False`` ,
          the output is a 0-D tensor representing the product of all elements in the self tensor.
        - If `dim` is int, set as 1, and `keepdim` is ``False`` ,
          the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_2, ..., x_R)`.
        - If `dim` is tuple(int), set as (1, 2), and `keepdim` is ``False`` ,
          the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_3, ..., x_R)`.
        - If `dim` is 1-D Tensor, set as [1, 2], and `keepdim` is ``False`` ,
          the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_3, ..., x_R)`.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If `dim` is not one of the following: int, tuple, list or Tensor.
        TypeError: If `keepdim` is not a bool.
        ValueError: If `dim` is out of range.
