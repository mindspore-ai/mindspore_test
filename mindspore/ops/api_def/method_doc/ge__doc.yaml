    ge_(other) -> Tensor

    Computes the value of :math:`self >= other` element-wise.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Note:
        When `self` and `other` have different shapes, `other` should be able to broadcast to `self`.

    Args:
        other (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): The other input is a number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape and the data type are the same as those of `self` .

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If `other` cannot be broadcast to `self`.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> other = Tensor(np.array([2, 2, 2]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> output = x.ge_(other)
        >>> print(output)
        [ 0  1  1]
        >>> print(x)
        [ 0  1  1]
