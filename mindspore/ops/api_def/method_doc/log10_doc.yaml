log10:
  description: |
    log10() -> Tensor

    Returns the logarithm to the base 10 of a tensor element-wise.

    .. math::
        y_i = \log_10(x_i)

    .. warning::
        - This is an experimental API that is subject ot change or deletion.
        - If the self value of operator Log10 is within the range (0, 0.01] or [0.95, 1.05], the output accuracy
          may be affacted.

    .. note::
        The value of `self` must be greater than 0.

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same shape as the `self`, and the dtype changes according to the `self.dtype`.

        - if `self.dtype` is in [float16, float32, float64, bfloat16, complex64, complex128], the output dtype is
          the same as the `self.dtype`.
        - if `self.dtype` is double type, the output dtype is float64.
        - if `self.dtype` is integer or boolean type on Ascend, the output dtype is float32.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `self.dtype` is not one of bool, uint8, int8, int16, int32, int64, bfloat16, float16, float32,
            float64, double, complex64, complex128.
        TypeError: If `self.dtype` is integer or boolean type on CPU and GPU.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 3.0, 5.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = x.log10()
        >>> print(output)
