bitwise_xor:
    description: |
        bitwise_xor(other) ->Tensor

        Returns bitwise `xor` of two tensors element-wise.

        Note:
            `self` and `other` comply with the type conversion rules to make the data types consistent.

        Args:
            other (Tensor, Number.number): The shape is the same as the `self` or can be broadcast to the shape of `self`.

        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same type as the `self` and has the same shape as after broadcasting.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor
            >>> input = Tensor(np.array([0, 0, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1]), mindspore.int16)
            >>> other = Tensor(np.array([0, 1, 1, -1, -1, 2, 3]), mindspore.int16)
            >>> output = input.bitwise_xor(other)
            >>> print(output)
            [ 0  1  0  0 -2  3  2]
