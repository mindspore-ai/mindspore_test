    select(dim, index) -> Tensor
    
    Slices the `self` tensor along the selected dimension at the given index.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        dim (int): the dimension to slice.
        index (int): the index to select with.

    Returns:
        Tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> input = Tensor([[2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 2, 4, 5]])
        >>> y = Tensor.select(input, 0, 0)
        >>> print(y)
        [2 3 4 5]

    .. method:: Tensor.select(condition, y) -> Tensor
        :noindex:
    
    The conditional tensor determines whether the corresponding element in the output must be
    selected from `self` (if True) or `y` (if False) based on the value of each
    element.
    
    It can be defined as:
    
    .. math::
        out_i = \begin{cases}
        self_i, & \text{if } condition_i \\
        y_i, & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    
    Args:
        condition (Tensor[bool]): The condition tensor, decides which element is chosen.
            The shape is :math:`(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, ..., x_R)`.
        y (Union[Tensor, int, float]): The second Tensor to be selected.
            If `y` is a Tensor, its shape should be or be braodcast to :math:`(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N, ..., x_R)`.
            If `y` is int or float, it will be casted to int32 or float32, and broadcast to the same shape as `self`.
            There must be at least one Tensor between `self` and `y`.
    
    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same shape as `condition`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If y is not a Tensor, int or float.
        ValueError: The shape of inputs cannot be broadcast.

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> # Both input are Tensor
        >>> cond = Tensor([True, False])
        >>> x = Tensor([2,3], mindspore.float32)
        >>> y = Tensor([1,2], mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = Tensor.select(x, cond, y)
        >>> print(output)
        [2. 2.]
