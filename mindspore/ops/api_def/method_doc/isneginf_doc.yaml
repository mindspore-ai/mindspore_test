isneginf:
  description: |
    isneginf() -> Tensor

    Determines which elements are -inf for each position.

    .. warning::
        - For Ascend, it is only supported on platforms above Atlas A2.

    Returns:
        Tensor with the same shape as the `self`, where elements are `True` if the corresponding element in the `self` is negative infinity, and `False` otherwise.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> from mindspore import dtype as mstype
        >>> x = Tensor([[-float("inf"), float("inf")], [1, -float("inf")]], mstype.float32)
        >>> output = x.isneginf()
        >>> print(output)
        [[ True False]
         [False  True]]
