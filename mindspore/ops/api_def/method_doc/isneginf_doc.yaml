isneginf:
  description: |
    isneginf(input) -> Tensor

    Determines which elements are -inf for each position.

    .. warning::
        - This is an experimental API that is subject to change.
        - For Ascend, it is only supported on platforms above Atlas A2.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): Input Tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor with the same shape as the input, where elements are `True` if the corresponding element in the `input` is negative infinity, and `False` otherwise.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> from mindspore import ops, Tensor
        >>> from mindspore import dtype as mstype
        >>> output = ops.isneginf(Tensor([[-float("inf"), float("inf")], [1, -float("inf")]], mstype.float32))
        >>> print(output)
        [[ True False]
         [False  True]]
