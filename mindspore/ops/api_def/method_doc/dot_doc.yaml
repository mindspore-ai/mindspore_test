dot:
  description: |
    dot(other) -> Tensor

    Computes the dot product of two 1D tensor.

    Args:
        other (Tensor): The input in the dot product, must be 1D.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is [] and the data type is same as `self`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `other` is not tensor.
        RuntimeError: If dtypes of `self` and `other` are not same.
        RuntimeError: If shapes of `self` and `other` are not same.
        RuntimeError: If shapes of `self` and `other` are not 1D.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> input = Tensor([2.0, 3.0], mindspore.float32)
        >>> other = Tensor([2.0, 1.0], mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = Tensor.dot(input, other)  # input.dot(other)
        >>> print(output)
        [7.        ]
        >>> print(output.dtype)
        Float32
