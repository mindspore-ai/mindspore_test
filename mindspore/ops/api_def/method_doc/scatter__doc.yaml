    scatter_(dim, index, src) -> Tensor

    Update the value in `src` to update `self` according to the specified `index`.

    Index the dimension `self` selected by `dim` using `index` , traverse the other
    dimensions in sequence, update the value of `src` to `self` , and return `self` .

    This operator is the inverse of the in-place version of :func:`mindspore.Tensor.gather` .

    This operation provides another three overloads to support parameter `reduce` and scalar value.

    Here's an example using a 3-dimension tensor.

    .. code-block::

        self[index[i][j][k]][j][k] = src[i][j][k]  # if dim == 0

        self[i][j][index[i][j][k]] = src[i][j][k]  # if dim == 2

    .. warning::
        - If multiple indexes point to the same position in `self` , the final value of
          this position in `self` is uncertain.
        - On Ascend, behavior is unpredictable when the value of `index` is not in the
          range `[-self.shape[dim], self.shape[dim])` in forward.
        - This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    .. note::
        The inverse gradient from `self` to `src` can be calculated only when
        the shape of src is the same as that of `index`.

    Args:
        dim (int): Which axis to scatter. Accepted range is `[-r, r)` where `r` is the rank of `self` .
        index (Tensor): The index to access `self` on the target axis specified by `dim` whose dtype must be int32
            or int64. If it is an empty Tensor, no operations is performed and directly returns `self` . Otherwise,
            its rank must be the same as `self` and the value range of each element must be `[-s, s)`
            where `s` is the size of `self` along axis `dim` .
        src (Tensor): The data to doing the update operation with `self` . It should have the same dtype and rank
            as `self` .

    Returns:
        Tensor, the modified `self` itself.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If type of `self` , `index` or `src` is unsupported.
        RuntimeError: If `dim` is out of the range `[-r, r)` .
        RuntimeError: If rank of `self` is larger than 8.
        RuntimeError: If dtype of tensor `self` , `index` or `src` is unsupported.
        RuntimeError: If dtype of `self` is not equal to the dtype of `src` .
        RuntimeError: If `self` , `index`, or `src` have different ranks and `index` is not an empty tensor.
        RuntimeError: If there is a dimension `d` that makes `index.size(d) > src.size(d)` .
        RuntimeError: If there is a dimension `d` that makes `index.size(d) > self.size(d)` .

        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, int64, float32
        >>> this_tensor = Tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=float32)
        >>> index = Tensor([[1, 0], [1, 0]], dtype=int64)
        >>> src = Tensor([[4, 3], [2, 1]], dtype=float32)

    .. method:: Tensor.scatter_(dim, index, src, *, reduce) -> Tensor
        :noindex:

    Update the value in `src` to update `self` according to the specified `index`.

    Using the operation specified by `reduce` to index the dimension `self` selected
    by `dim` using `index` , traverse the other dimensions in sequence, accumulate or
    multiply the value of `src` to `self` , and return `self` .

    This operator is the inverse of the in-place version of :func:`mindspore.Tensor.gather` .

    Expect that the replacement operation changes to accumulation or multiplication
    based on the parameter `reduce`, other operations are the same as the overloaded
    function that accept `src` without the parameter `reduce` .

    Here's an example using a 3-dimension tensor.

    .. code-block::

        self[index[i][j][k]][j][k] += src[i][j][k]  # if dim == 0, reduce == "add"

        self[i][j][index[i][j][k]] *= src[i][j][k]  # if dim == 2, reduce == "multiply"

    .. warning::
        - If multiple indexes point to the same position in `self` , the final value of
          this position in `self` is uncertain.
        - On Ascend, behavior is unpredictable when the value of `index` is not in the
          range `[-self.shape[dim], self.shape[dim])` in forward.
        - This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    .. note::
        This overload function does not support reverse gradient calculation and will return zeros if calculate gradient.

    Args:
        dim (int): Which axis to scatter. Accepted range is `[-r, r)` where `r` is the rank of `self` .
        index (Tensor): The index to access `self` on the target axis specified by `dim` whose dtype must be int32
            or int64. If it is an empty Tensor, no operations is performed and directly returns `self` . Otherwise,
            its rank must be the same as `self` and the value range of each element must be `[-s, s)`
            where `s` is the size of `self` along axis `dim` .
        src (Tensor): The data to doing the accumulate or multiply operation with `self` . It should have the
            same dtype and rank as `self` .

    Keyword Args:
        reduce (str): Reduce operation, supports ``"add"`` and ``"multiply"`` . When `reduce` is ``"add"`` , `src`
            is accumulated to `input` base on `index` . When `reduce` is ``"multiply"`` , `src` is multiplied
            to `input` base on `index` .

    Returns:
        Tensor, the modified `self` itself.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If type of `self` , `index` or `src` is unsupported.
        ValueError: If `reduce` is a str but not ``"add"`` or ``"multiply"`` .
        RuntimeError: If `dim` is out of the range `[-r, r)` .
        RuntimeError: If rank of `self` is larger than 8.
        RuntimeError: If dtype of tensor `self` , `index` or `src` is unsupported.
        RuntimeError: If dtype of `self` is not equal to the dtype of `src` .
        RuntimeError: If `self` , `index`, or `src` have different ranks and `index` is not an empty tensor.
        RuntimeError: If there is a dimension `d` that makes `index.size(d) > src.size(d)` .

    .. method:: Tensor.scatter_(dim, index, value) -> Tensor
        :noindex:

    Update the value `value` to update `self` according to the specified `index`.

    Index the dimension `self` selected by `dim` using `index` , traverse the other
    dimensions in sequence, update the value `value` to `self` , and return `self` .

    This operator is the inverse of the in-place version of :func:`mindspore.Tensor.gather` .

    It can be considered that after the value is broadcasted as a Tensor whose shape
    and dtype are consistent with `self` , other operations are the same as the
    overloaded function that accept `src` without the parameter `reduce` .

    Here's an example using a 3-dimension tensor.

            where `s` is the size of `self` along axis `dim` .
        value (int, float, bool): The data to doing the update operation with `self` . It can be considered as being
            broadcasted into a Tensor whose shape and dtype are the same as `self` , and then be regarded as `src`
            for calculation.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the modified `self` itself.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If type of `self` , `index` or `value` is unsupported.
        RuntimeError: If `dim` is out of the range `[-r, r)` .
