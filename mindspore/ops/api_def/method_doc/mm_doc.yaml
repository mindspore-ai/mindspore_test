mm:
  description: |
    mm(mat2) -> Tensor

    Returns the matrix product of two arrays.
    If `self` is a :math:`(n \times m)` Tensor, `mat2` is a
    :math:`(m \times p)` Tensor, `out` will be a :math:`(n \times p)` Tensor.

    Note:
        This function cannot support broadcasting.
        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.matmul` instead if you need a broadcastable function.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        mat2 (Tensor): The second matrix of matrix multiplication.
            The last dimension of `self` must be the same size as the first dimension of `mat2`.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the matrix product of the inputs.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `self` or `mat2` is not a Tensor.
        RuntimeError: If the last dimension of `self` is not the same size as the
            second-to-last dimension of `mat2`.
        RuntimeError: If dtype of `self` or `mat2` is not float16, float32 or bfloat16.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> x1 = ms.Tensor(np.random.rand(2, 3), ms.float32)
        >>> x2 = ms.Tensor(np.random.rand(3, 4), ms.float32)
        >>> out = x1.mm(x2)
        >>> print(out.shape)
        (2, 4)
