copy_:
  description: |
    copy_(src, non_blocking=False) -> Tensor

    Copies the elements from `src` into `self` tensor and returns `self`.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        If Copying is performed between Ascend and Ascend, the `src` tensor must be broadcastable with the `self` tensor,
        and they can be of different data types.
        Copying is performed between CPU and Ascend or CPU and CPU are only supported if `self` and `src` have
        the same shape and data type and they are all contiguous.

    Args:
        src (Tensor): the source tensor to copy from.
        non_blocking (bool, optional): If ``True`` and copying is performed between CPU and Ascend, and `self` and `src`
            have the same shape and data type and are contiguous. The copy may occur asynchronously with respect to the
            host. For other cases, this argument has no effect. Default: ``False``.

    Returns:
        Return self Tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> a = Tensor(np.ones((3, 3)).astype("float32"))
        >>> b = Tensor(np.zeros((3, 3)).astype("float32"))
        >>> a.copy_(b)
        >>> print(a)
        [[0. 0. 0.]
         [0. 0. 0.]
         [0. 0. 0.]]
