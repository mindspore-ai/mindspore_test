fill_diagonal_:
  description: |
    fill_diagonal_(fill_value, warp=False) -> Tensor

    Fills the main diagonal of a Tensor in-place with a specified value and returns the result.
    The `self` has at least 2 dimensions, and all dimensions of `self` must be equal in length
    when the dimension of `self` is greater than 2.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        fill_value (number): The value to fill the diagonal of `self`.
        wrap (bool, optional): Controls whether the diagonal elements continue onto the
            remaining rows in case of a tall matrix(A matrix has more rows than columns). Default: ``False`` .

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same shape and data type as `self`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the dimension of `self` is not greater than 1.
        ValueError: If the size of each dimension is not equal, when the dimension is greater than 2.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]).astype(np.float32))
        >>> fill_value = 9.9
        >>> x.fill_diagonal_(fill_value)
        >>> print(x)
        [[9.9 2.  3. ]
         [4.  9.9 6. ]
         [7.  8.  9.9]]
