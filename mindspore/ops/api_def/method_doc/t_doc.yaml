    Transpose `self` .

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Returns:
        Tensor, transpose 2D tensor, return 1D tensor as it is.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the dimension of `self` is greater than 2.
        ValueError: If `self` is empty.
        TypeError: If `self` is not a tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = x.t()
        >>> print(output)
        [[ 1. 4.]
         [ 2. 5.]
