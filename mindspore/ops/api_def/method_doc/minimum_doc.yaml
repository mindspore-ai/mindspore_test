    minimum(other) -> Tensor
    
    Computes the minimum of input tensors element-wise.

    .. math::
        output_i = \min(tensor_i, other_i)

    Note:
        - `self` and `other` comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types
          consistent.
        - The `other` can be a tensor or a scalar.
        - When `other` is a tensor,
          dtypes of `self` and `other` cannot be bool at the same time, and the shapes of them could be broadcast.
        - When `other` is a scalar, the scalar could only be a constant.
        - Broadcasting is supported.
        - If one of the elements being compared is a NaN, then that element is returned.

    Args:
        other (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): The input is a number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is number or bool.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
        and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among `self` and `other`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `other` is not one of the following: Tensor, Number, bool.
        ValueError: If `self` and `other` are not the same shape after broadcast.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> # case 1 : same data type
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 5.0, 3.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> y = Tensor(np.array([4.0, 2.0, 6.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = x.minimum(y)
        >>> print(output)
        [1. 2. 3.]
        >>> # case 2 : different data type
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 5.0, 3.0]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> y = Tensor(np.array([4.0, 2.0, 6.0]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = x.minimum(y)
        >>> print(output.dtype)
        Float32
