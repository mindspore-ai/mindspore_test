deg2rad:
  description: |
    deg2rad() -> Tensor

    Returns a new tensor with each of the elements of input converted from angles in degrees to radians.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    .. note::
        The supported dtypes of the `self` tensor are as follows:

        - Ascend: float16, float32, float64, uint8, int8, int16, int32, int64, or bool.
        - CPU/GPU: float16, float32, float64.

    Returns:
        Tensor. For floating-point inputs (float16/float32/float64), the output dtype matches the `self`.
        If the `self` is uint8, int32, bool, etc., the output dtype is float32.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the dtype of `self` is complex64, complex128, uint16, uint32 and so on.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([[180., -180.], [360., -360.]]).astype(np.float32))
        >>> output = x.deg2rad()
        >>> print(output)
        [[ 3.1415927 -3.1415927]
         [ 6.2831855 -6.2831855]]
