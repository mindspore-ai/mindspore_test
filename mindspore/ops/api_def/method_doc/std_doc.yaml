    std(axis=None, ddof=0, keepdims=False) -> Tensor

    For details, please refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.std`.

    .. method:: Tensor.std(dim=None, *, correction=1, keepdim=False) -> Tensor
        :noindex:

    Calculates the standard deviation over the dimensions specified by `dim`. `dim` can be a single dimension, list of
    dimensions, or None to reduce over all dimensions.

    The standard deviation (:math:`\sigma`) is calculated as:

    .. math::
        \sigma =\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-\delta N}\sum_{j-1}^{N-1}\left(s e l f_{i j}-\overline{x_{i}}\right)^{2}}

    where :math:`x` is the sample set of elements, :math:`\bar{x}` is the sample mean, :math:`N` is the number
    of samples and :math:`\delta N` is the `correction`.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        dim (None, int, tuple(int), optional): The dimension or dimensions to reduce. Defaults to ``None``.
            If ``None``, all dimensions are reduced.

    Keyword Args:
        correction (int, optional): The difference between the sample size and sample degrees of freedom. Defaults
            to Bessel's correction. Defaults to ``1``.
        keepdim (bool, optional): Whether the output tensor has dim retained or not. If ``True`` , keep these
            reduced dimensions and the length is 1. If ``False``, don't keep these dimensions. Defaults to ``False``.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the standard deviation.
        Suppose the shape of `self` is :math:`(x_0, x_1, ..., x_R)`:

        - If `dim` is () and `keepdim` is set to ``False`` , returns a 0-D Tensor, indicating the standard deviation of
          all elements in `self`.
        - If `dim` is int, e.g. ``1`` and `keepdim` is set to ``False`` , then the returned Tensor has shape
          :math:`(x_0, x_2, ..., x_R)`.
        - If `dim` is tuple(int) or list(int), e.g. ``(1, 2)`` and `keepdim` is set to ``False`` , then the returned
          Tensor has shape :math:`(x_0, x_3, ..., x_R)`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `self` is not a Tensor.
        TypeError: If `self` is not in bfloat16, float16, float32.
        TypeError: If `dim` is not one of the followings: None, int, tuple.
        TypeError: If `correction` is not an int.
        TypeError: If `keepdim` is not a bool.
        ValueError: If `dim` is out of range :math:`[-self.ndim, self.ndim)`.

        >>> input = Tensor(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [-1, 1, 4]]).astype(np.float32))
        >>> output = input.std(dim=1, correction=1, keepdim=False)
