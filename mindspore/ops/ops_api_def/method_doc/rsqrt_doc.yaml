    description: |
        rsqrt(self) -> Tensor

        Computes reciprocal of square root of self tensor element-wise.

        .. math::
        
            out_{i} =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{input_{i}}}
    
        Args:
            self (Tensor): The self of rsqrt. Its each element must be a non-negative
                number, if an element is negative, the calculation result is nan.
    
        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same shape and dtype as the `self`.
    
        Raises:
            TypeError: If `self` is not a Tensor.
    
        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
    
        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore as ms
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input = Tensor([-0.0370,  0.2970,  1.5420, -0.9105])
            >>> output = input.rsqrt()
            >>> print(output)
