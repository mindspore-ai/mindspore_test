moe_gating_top_k_softmax:
    description: |
        In MoE calculation, Softmax calculation is done on the output of x, taking topk operation.

        Args:
            k (int): The k-value of topk, of size 0 <= k <= the size of x's -1 axis.

        Inputs:
            - **x** (Tensor) - The input to be computed. The tensor must be 2D or 3D. Supported dtypes: float16, bfloat16, float32.
            - **finished** (Tensor, optional) - A 1D or 2D Tensor. Supported dtype: bool. The shape of the tensor must be :math:`x.shape[:-1]`. Default: ``None``.

        Outputs:
            - **y** (Tensor) - The topk value taken after doing softmax on `x`. The data type is the same as `x`. The -1 axis of the shape has the same size as the `k` value, and the rest of the axes have the same size as the corresponding axes of `x`.
            - **expert_idx** (Tensor) - The index of the topk value, i.e., the expert's serial number, is taken after doing softmax on `x`. The shape is the same as `y`. The data type is int32.
            - **row_idx** (Tensor) - Indicates the original row position corresponding to each position, shape is consistent with `y`. The data type is int32.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If the data type of input Tensor does not match the description in args.
            ValueError: If the shape of input Tensor does not match the description in args.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``
