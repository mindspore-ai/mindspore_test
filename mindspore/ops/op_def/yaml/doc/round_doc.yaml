round:
    description: |
        Returns half to even of a tensor element-wise.

        .. math::
            out_i \approx input_i
        
        .. note::
            The input data types supported by the Ascend platform include 
            bfloat16 (Atlas training series products are not supported), float16, float32, float64, int32, and int64.

        Inputs:
            - **input** (Tensor) - The input tensor.
            - **decimals** (int, optional) - Number of decimal places to round to (default: 0). If decimals is 
              negative, it specifies the number of positions to the left of the decimal point. It supports 
              converting the single-element tensor to an int. When `input` type is int32 or int64, the `decimals`
              should be 0.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, has the same shape and type as the `input`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.
            RuntimeError: If `input` type is int32 or int64, the `decimals` is not 0.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input = Tensor(np.array([0.8, 1.5, 2.3, 2.5, -4.5]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> round = ops.Round()
            >>> output = round(input)
            >>> print(output)
            [ 1.  2.  2.  2. -4.]
