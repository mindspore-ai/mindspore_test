  description: |
    Calculate the overlap area between rotated rectangles.
    
    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    .. note::
        The input data types supported by the Ascend platform include 
        bfloat16, float16, float32.
    
    Args:
        trans (bool, optional): Distinguish the rectangles representations
            of boxes and query_boxes. If ``True``, the format of boxes
            and query_boxes is ``'xyxyt'``, else the format is ``'xywht'``. 
            The default value is ``False``.
        mode (int, optional): Distinguish the calculation mode. If the value 
            is ``1``, the calculation mode is ``'iof'``, else the 
            calculation mode is ``'iou'``. The default value is ``0``.
        is_cross (bool, optional): If ``True``, use cross-calculation, else use 
            one-to-one calculation. The default value is ``True``.
        v_threshold (float, optional): Tolerance threshold for vertex determination.
            The default value is ``0.0``.
        e_threshold (float, optional): Tolerance threshold for edge intersection 
            determination. The default value is ``0.0``.
    
    Inputs:
        boxes (Tensor): The first set of rectangles which has a 
            shape of :math:`(B, N, 5)`.
        query_boxes (Tensor): The second set of rectangles which 
            has a shape of :math:`(B, K, 5)`.
    
    Outputs:
        Tensor, the shape is :math:`(B, N, K)`.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If `boxes` is not a Tensor.
        TypeError: If `query_boxes` is not a Tensor.
        ValueError: If `boxes` and `query_boxes` do not has same first dim.
        ValueError: If the third dimension of `boxes` or `query_boxes` is not ``5``.
    
    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``
    
    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> a = np.random.uniform(0,1,(2,2,5)).astype(np.float16)
        >>> b = np.random.uniform(0,1,(2,3,5)).astype(np.float16)
        >>> box1 = Tensor(a)
        >>> box2 = Tensor(b)
        >>> output = ops.rotated_iou(box1, box2, trans=False, mode=0, is_cross=True)
