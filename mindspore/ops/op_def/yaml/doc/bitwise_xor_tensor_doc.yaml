bitwise_xor_tensor:
    description: |
        Returns bitwise `xor` of two tensors element-wise.

        Inputs:
            - **input** (Tensor) - The input tensor must be of integral or Boolean types.
            - **other** (Tensor) - The second input tensor with same type as the `input`.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, has the same type as the `input`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``
