logsumexp:
    description: |
        Computes the logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of all elements along the specified `dim` dimension of the `input` (with numerical stabilization), and retains the dimension based on the `keepdim` parameter.

        .. math::

            logsumexp(input) = \log(\sum(e^{input-input_{max}})) + input_{max}

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): Input Tensor.
            dim (Union[int, tuple(int), list(int)], optional): The dimension to be reduced (the value should be within `[0, len(input.shape) - 1]`), when the `dim` is `()`, all dimensions are reduced.
            keepdim (bool, optional): Whether the output tensor retains the dimension `dim`, default: `False`.

        Returns:
            Tensor, the dtype changes according to the `input.dtype`, and the shape changes according to the values of `dim` and `keepdim`.

            - If `input.dtype` is in [float16, float32, bfloat16], the output dtype is the same as the `input.dtype`.
            - If `input.dtype` is an integer or boolean type, the output dtype is float32.
            - If `dim` is (), and `keepdim` is False, the output is a 0-D tensor representing the logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of all elements in the `input` tensor.
            - If `dim` is `1`, and `keepdim` is False, the shape of output is :math:`(input.shape[0], input.shape[2], ..., input.shape[n])`.
            - If `dim` is `(1, 2)`, and `keepdim` is False, the shape of output is :math:`(input.shape[0], input.shape[3], ..., input.shape[n])`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: If dtype of `input` is not one of: bool, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, float16, float32, bfloat16.
            TypeError: If `dim` is not an int or tuple(int) or list(list).
            TypeError: If `keepdim` is not a bool.
            ValueError: If the value of any elements of `dim` is not in the range `[0, len(input.shape) - 1]`.
            RuntimeError: If any element of `dim` is repeated.

            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.random.randn(3, 4, 5, 6).astype(np.float32))
            >>> output = ops.logsumexp_ext(x, 1, keep_dims=True)
            >>> print(output.shape)
            (3, 1, 5, 6)
