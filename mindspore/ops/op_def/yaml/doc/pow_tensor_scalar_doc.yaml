pow_tensor_scalar:
    description: |
        Calculates the `exponent` power of each element in `input`.
        
        When `exponent` is a Tensor, the shapes of `input` and `exponent` must be broadcastable.

        .. math::

            out_{i} = input_{i} ^{ exponent_{i}}

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The first input is a tensor whose data type is
                `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_ or
                `bool <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_.
            exponent (Number): The second input is a Number.

        Returns:
            Tensor, the shape is the same as the one after broadcasting,
            and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 4.0]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> exponent = 3.0
            >>> output = ops.pow_ext(input, exponent)
            >>> print(output)
