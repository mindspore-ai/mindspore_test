logaddexp:
    description: |
        Computes the logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the inputs.
        This function is useful in statistics where the calculated probabilities of events may be
        so small as to exceed the range of normal floating point numbers.

        .. math::

            out_i = \log(exp(input_i) + \exp(other_i))

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): Input Tensor. The dtype of `input` must be float.
            other (Tensor): Input Tensor. The dtype of `other` must be float.
                If the shape of `input` is not equal to the shape of `other`,
                they must be broadcastable to a common shape (which becomes the shape of the output).

        Returns:
            Tensor, with the same dtype as `input` and `other`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` or `other` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: The dtype of `input` or `other` is not float.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x1 = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]).astype(np.float16))
            >>> x2 = Tensor(np.array(2).astype(np.float16))
            >>> output = ops.logaddexp_ext(x1, x2)
            >>> print(output)
            [2.312 2.693 3.312]
