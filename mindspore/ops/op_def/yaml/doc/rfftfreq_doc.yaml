rfftfreq:
    description: |
      Computes the sample frequencies for `rfft` with a signal of size `n`.
      For instance, Given a length `n` and a sample spacing `d` , the returned result `f` is:

      .. math::
          f = [0, 1, ..., n // 2] / (d * n)

      Note:
          - `rfftfreq` is currently only used in `mindscience` scientific computing scenarios and
            dose not support other usage scenarios.
          - `rfftfreq` is not supported on Windows platform yet.

      Args:
          n (int): Window length.
          d (float, optional): Sample spacing (inverse of the sampling rate). Default: ``1.0`` .
          dtype (mindspore.dtype, optional): The dtype of the returned frequencies. Default: ``None`` represents float32.

      Returns:
          Tensor, Array of length ``n`` containing the sample frequencies.

      Raises:
          ValueError: If `n` is less than 1.

      Supported Platforms:
          ``Ascend`` ``CPU``

      Examples:
          >>> import mindspore
          >>> from mindspore import ops
          >>> out = ops.rfftfreq(n=4, d=1.0)
          >>> print(out)
          [0.   0.25 0.5 ]
