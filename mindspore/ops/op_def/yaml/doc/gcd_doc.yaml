gcd:
    description: |
        Computes greatest common divisor of input tensors element-wise.

        Support broadcasting and type promotion. Data types should be one of: int16 (supported when using the Ascend
        backend, Graph mode is only supported when the graph compilation level is O0), int32, int64.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The first input tensor.
            other (Tensor): The second input tensor.

        Returns:
            Tensor

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> input = mindspore.tensor([7, 8, 9])
            >>> other = mindspore.tensor([14, 6, 12])
            >>> mindspore.ops.gcd(input, other)
            Tensor(shape=[3], dtype=Int64, value= [7, 2, 3])
