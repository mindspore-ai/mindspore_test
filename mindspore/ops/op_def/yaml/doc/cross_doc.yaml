cross:
    description: |
        Returns the cross product of vectors in dimension `dim` of input and other.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.cross` for more details.

        Args:
            dim (int): Specified dim along which to compute cross product with. Default: ``-65530`` .

        Inputs:
            - **input** (Tensor) - Input Tensor.
            - **other** (Tensor) - Another input Tensor, must have the same shape and
              the same type as `input`, and the size of their `dim` dimension should be 3.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, has the same shape and type as inputs.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor
            >>> from mindspore import dtype as mstype
            >>> from mindspore import ops
            >>> cross = ops.Cross(dim = 0)
            >>> x1 = Tensor([1, 2, 3], mstype.int8)
            >>> x2 = Tensor([1, 2, 3], mstype.int8)
            >>> output = cross(x1, x2)
            >>> print(output)
            [0 0 0]
