        Returns input cast to the type of the with the other.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Note:
            When converting complex numbers to boolean type, the imaginary part of the complex number is not
            taken into account. As long as the real part is non-zero, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The shape of tensor is :math:`(x_0, x_1, ..., x_R)`. The tensor whose data type is to be converted.
            other (Tensor): The shape of tensor is :math:`(x_0, x_1, ..., x_R)`. The tensor whose data type is specified.

        Returns:
            Tensor, the shape of tensor is the same as `input`, :math:`(x_0, x_1, ..., x_R)`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: If `other` is not a Tensor.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input_np = np.random.randn(2, 3, 4, 5).astype(np.float32)
            >>> input = Tensor(input_np)
            >>> other_np = np.random.randn(2, 3, 4).astype(np.int32)
            >>> other = Tensor(other_np)
            >>> output = ops.type_as(input, other)
            >>> print(output.dtype)
            Int32
            >>> print(output.shape)
            (2, 3, 4, 5)
