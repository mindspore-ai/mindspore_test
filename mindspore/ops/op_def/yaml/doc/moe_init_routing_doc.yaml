moe_init_routing:
    description: |
        Performs routing on the computation result of MoeGatingTopKSoftmax.

        Inputs:
            - **x** (Tensor) - 2D tensor, which contains input feature tokens. The shape is (NUM_ROWS, H).
            - **row_idx** (Tensor) - Original row ID of each position. The shape must be the same as that of expertForSourceRow.
            - **expert_idx** (Tensor) - 2D tensor, indicating k experts corresponding to each row of features in the output of aclnnMoeGatingTopKSoftmax. The shape is (NUM_ROWS, K). 
            active_num (int64): maximum number of rows that can be processed, that is, the maximum number of rows that are valid in expandedXOut.

        Outputs:
            - **expanded_x** (Tensor) - 2D tensor, indicating features extended based on expertIdx. The shape is (min(NUM_ROWS, activeNum) * k, H).
            - **expanded_row_idx** (Tensor) - 1D tensor, indicating mapping between expandedX and x. The shape is (NUM_ROWS*K).
            - **expanded_expert_idx** (Tensor) - sorted result of expertIdx.

        Raises:
            ShapeError: If the shape of input Tensor does not match the description in args.
