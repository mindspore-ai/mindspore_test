    description: | 
        Perform a QR decomposition on the input tensor :math:`A = QR`. 
        
        The tensor is decomposed into the product of an orthogonal matrix `Q` and an upper triangular matrix `R`.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The input tensor.

        Returns:
            Tuple(`y`, `tau`) of 2 tensors.

            - **y** (Tensor) - Store the matrices `Q` and `R` implicitly. The matrix `Q` (Householder vectors) is
              stored below the diagonal, and the elements of matrix `R` are stored on and above the diagonal. 
            - **tau** (Tensor) - Store the scaling factors of each Householder transformation (Householder reflection 
              coefficients).

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> input = mindspore.tensor([[-2.0, -1.0], [1.0, 2.0]])
            >>> y, tau = mindspore.ops.geqrf(input)
            >>> print(y)

             [-0.236068   1.3416407]]
            >>> print(tau)
