        Returns a copy of the input tensor.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Note:
            This function is differentiable, and gradients will flow back directly from the calculation
            result of the function to the `input`.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): A tensor to be copied.

        Returns:
            Tensor, with the same data, shape and type as `input`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input = Tensor(np.ones((3,3)).astype("float32"))
            >>> output = ops.auto_generate.clone(input)
            >>> print(output)
            [[1. 1. 1.]
             [1. 1. 1.]
             [1. 1. 1.]]
