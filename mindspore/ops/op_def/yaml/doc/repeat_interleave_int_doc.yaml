repeat_interleave_int:
    description: |
        Repeat elements of a tensor along an axis, like `numpy.repeat`.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The tensor to repeat values for. Must be of type: float16,
                float32, int8, uint8, int16, int32, or int64.
            repeats (int): The number of times to repeat, must be positive.
            dim (int, optional): The dim along which to repeat, Default: ``None``. if dims is None,
                the input Tensor will be flattened and the output will alse be flattened.
            output_size (int, optional): Total output size for the given axis (e.g. sum of repeats),
                Default: ``None``. 

        Returns:
            One tensor with values repeated along the specified dim. If input has shape
            :math:`(s1, s2, ..., sn)` and dim is i, the output will have shape :math:`(s1, s2, ...,
            si * repeats, ..., sn)`. The output type will be the same as the type of `input`.
