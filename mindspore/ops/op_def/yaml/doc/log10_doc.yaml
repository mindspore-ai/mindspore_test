log10:
    description: |
        Returns the logarithm to the base 10 of a tensor element-wise.

        .. math::
            y_i = \log_{10}(x_i)

        .. warning::
            - This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.
            - If the input value of operator Log10 is within the range (0, 0.01] or [0.95, 1.05], the output accuracy
              may be affacted.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): Input Tensor of any dimension. The value must be greater than 0.

        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same shape as the `input`, and the dtype changes according to the `input.dtype`.
            
            - if `input.dtype` is in [float16, float32, float64, bfloat16], the output dtype is the same as the `input.dtype`.
            - if `input.dtype` is integer or boolean type, the output dtype is float32.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([3.0, 5.0, 7.0]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> output = ops.auto_generate.log10_ext(x)
            >>> print(output)
