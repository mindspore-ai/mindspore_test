soft_margin_loss:
    description: |
        Calculate the soft margin loss of input and target.

        Creates a criterion that optimizes a two-class classification
        logistic loss between input tensor :math:`x` and target tensor :math:`y`
        (containing 1 or -1).

        .. math::
            \text{loss}(x, y) = \sum_i \frac{\log(1 + \exp(-y[i]*x[i]))}{\text{x.nelement}()}

        where :math:`x.nelement()` is the number of elements of :math:`x`.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): Predict data. Data type must be float16, float32, bfloat16 (Atlas training series products are not supported).
            target (Tensor): Ground truth data, with the same shape as `input`. In GE mode, the data type should be the same as `input`.
            reduction (str, optional): Apply specific reduction method to the output: ``'none'`` , ``'mean'`` , ``'sum'`` . Default: ``'mean'`` .
        
                - ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied.
                - ``'mean'``: compute and return the mean of elements in the output.
                - ``'sum'``: the output elements will be summed.

        Returns:
            Tensor or Scalar. If `reduction` is ``'none'``, its shape is the same as `input`.
            Otherwise, a scalar value will be returned.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` or `target` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: If dtype of `input` or `target` is not float16, float32, bfloat16 (Atlas training series products are not supported).
            ValueError: If shape of `input` is not the same as that of `target`.
            ValueError: If `reduction` is not one of ``'none'``, ``'mean'`` or ``'sum'``.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> logits = Tensor(np.array([[0.3, 0.7], [0.5, 0.5]]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> labels = Tensor(np.array([[-1, 1], [1, -1]]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> output = ops.soft_margin_loss(logits, labels)
            >>> print(output)
            0.6764238
