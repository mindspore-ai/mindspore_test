smooth_l1_loss:
    description: |
        Calculate the smooth L1 loss, and the L1 loss function has robustness.

        Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.smooth_l1_loss` for more details.

        .. warning::
            This API has poor performance on CPU and it is recommended to run it on the Ascend/GPU.
        
        Args:
            beta (number, optional): A parameter used to control the point where the function will change between
                L1 to L2 loss. Default: ``1.0`` .

                - Ascend: The value should be equal to or greater than zero.
                - CPU/GPU: The value should be greater than zero.
            reduction (str, optional): Apply specific reduction method to the output: ``'none'`` , ``'mean'`` ,
                ``'sum'`` . Default: ``'none'`` .

                - ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied.
                - ``'mean'``: compute and return the mean of elements in the output.
                - ``'sum'``: the output elements will be summed.

        Inputs:
            - **logits** (Tensor) - Input Tensor of any dimension. Supported dtypes: 

              - Ascend: float16, float32, bfloat16.
              - CPU/GPU: float16, float32, float64.
            - **labels** (Tensor) - Ground truth data.
                
              - CPU/Ascend: has the same shape as the `logits`, `logits` and `labels` comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types consistent.
              - GPU: has the same shape and dtype as the `logits`.

        Outputs:
            Tensor, if `reduction` is ``'none'``, then output is a tensor with the same shape as `logits`. Otherwise the shape of output tensor is :math:`()`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> loss = ops.SmoothL1Loss()
            >>> logits = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> labels = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 2]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> output = loss(logits, labels)
            >>> print(output)
            [0.  0.  0.5]
