cdist:
    description: |
        Computes p-norm distance between each pair of row vectors of two input Tensors.

        Note:
            - On Ascend, the supported dtypes are float16 and float32.
            - On CPU, the supported dtypes are float16 and float32.
            - On GPU, the supported dtypes are float32 and float64.

        Args:
            x1 (Tensor): Input tensor of shape :math:`(B, P, M)`.
                Letter :math:`B` represents 0 or positive int number.
                When :math:`B` is equal to 0, it means this dimension can be ignored,
                i.e. shape of the tensor is :math:`(P, M)`.
            x2 (Tensor): Input tensor of shape :math:`(B, R, M)`, has the same dtype as `x1`.
            p (float, optional): P value for the p-norm distance to calculate between each
                vector pair, P >= 0. Default: ``2.0`` .

        Returns:
            Tensor, p-norm distance, has the same dtype as `x1`, its shape is :math:`(B, P, R)`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `x1` or `x2` is not Tensor.
            TypeError: If dtype of `x1` or `x2` is not listed in the "Note" above.
            TypeError: If `p` is not float32.
            ValueError: If `p` is negative.
            ValueError: If dimension of `x1` is not the same as `x2`.
            ValueError: If dimension of `x1` or `x2` is neither 2 nor 3.
            ValueError: If the batch dim of `x1` and `x2` can not broadcast.
            ValueError: If the number of columns of `x1` is not the same as that of `x2`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([[[1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0]]]).astype(np.float32))
            >>> y = Tensor(np.array([[[3.0, 3.0], [3.0, 3.0]]]).astype(np.float32))
            >>> output = ops.cdist(x, y, 2.0)
            >>> print(output)
            [[[2.8284273 2.8284273]
              [1.4142137 1.4142137]]]
