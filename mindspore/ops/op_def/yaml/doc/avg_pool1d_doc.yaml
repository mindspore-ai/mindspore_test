avg_pool1d:
    description: |
      Applies a 1D average pooling over an input Tensor which can be regarded as a composition of 1D input planes.

      Typically the input is of shape :math:`(N_{in}, C_{in}, L_{in})`, avg_pool1d outputs regional average in the
      :math:`(L_{in})`-dimension. Given kernel size as :math:`ks = l_{ker}` and `stride` as :math:`s = s_0`, the
      operation is as follows.

      .. math::
          \text{output}(N_i, C_j, l) = \frac{1}{l_{ker}} \sum_{n=0}^{l_{ker}-1}
          \text{input}(N_i, C_j, s_0 \times l + n)

      .. warning::
          This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

      Args:
          input (Tensor): Tensor of shape :math:`(N, C_{in}, L_{in})`.
          kernel_size (Union(int, tuple[int])): The size of kernel window used to take the average value.
          stride (Union(int, tuple[int]), optional): The distance of kernel moving. `stride` can either be an int
              number or a tuple of one int number. Default: ``None``, the same value as `kernel_size`.
          padding (Union(int, tuple[int]), optional): The pad length to be filled. `padding` can either be an integer
              or a tuple of one integer. Default: ``0`` .
          ceil_mode (bool, optional): If True, apply ceil instead of floor to compute the output shape. Default: ``False``.
          count_include_pad (bool, optional): If True, include the zero-padding in the averaging calculation. Default: ``True`` .

      Returns:
          Tensor of shape :math:`(N, C_{in}, L_{out})`.

      Raises:
          TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.
          TypeError: If `kernel_size` or `stride` is not an int.
          TypeError: If `ceil_mode` or `count_include_pad` is not a bool.
          ValueError: If `kernel_size` or `stride` is less than `1`.
          ValueError: If `kernel_size` or `stride` or `padding` is not int nor a tuple whose length is greater than `1`.
