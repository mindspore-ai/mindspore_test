conj:
    description: |
        Returns a tensor of complex numbers that are the complex conjugate of each element in input.
        The complex numbers in input must be of the form a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.
    
        The complex conjugate returned by this operation is of the form a - bj.
    
        If `input` is real, it is returned unchanged.
    
        Args:
            input (Tensor): The input tensor.
    
        Returns:
            Tensor
    
        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
    
        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> x = mindspore.tensor(1.3+0.4j, mindspore.complex64)
            >>> output = mindspore.ops.conj(x)
            >>> output
            Tensor(shape=[], dtype=Complex64, value= 1.3-0.4j)
