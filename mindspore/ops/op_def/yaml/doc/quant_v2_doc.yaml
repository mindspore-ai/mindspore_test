quant_v2:
    description: |
        Returns the quantized value of input x.

        If `sqrt_mode` is False:

        .. math::
            y = round(scale * x + offset)

        If `sqrt_mode` is True:

        .. math::
            y = round(scale * x * scale + offset)

        Inputs:
            x (Tensor) : Input tensor. 
                Its data type must be mindspore.float16, mindspore.float32 or mindspore.bfloat32.
            scale (Tensor) : Scaling ratio tensor in quantization. Its type is the same as x.
                Its shape in the last axis must equal to the shape of x in the last axis,
                and shapes of other dimensions must be 1.
            offset (Tensor) : Offset tensor in quantization. Its type is the same as x.
                Its shape in the last axis must equal to the shape of x in the last axis,
                and shapes of other dimensions must be 1.
            sqrt_mode (bool) : Specifies whether to perform square root on `scale`. Only support: ``False``.
            rounding_mode (str) : Specifies the way to round. Only support: "ROUND".
            dst_type (Type) : Specifies the output type. Only support ``int8``.

        Returns:
            Tensor, the quantized output tensor of type mindspore.int8. Its shape is the same as x.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If input, scale or offset is not a Tensor.
            ValueError: The shape of scale or offset in the last axis is different from the shape of x in the last axis.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``
        
        Examples:
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor
            >>> from mindspore.ops.operations import _infer_ops as infer_ops
            >>> x = Tensor([100.0, 150.0], mstype.float32)
            >>> scale = Tensor([80.0, 40.0], mstype.float32)
            >>> offset = Tensor([0.0, 2.0], mstype.float32)
            >>> quant = infer_ops.QuantV2()
            >>> y = quant(x, scale, offset, False, "Round", mstype.int8)
