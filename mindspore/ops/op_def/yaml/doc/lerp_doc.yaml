lerp:
  description: |
    Does a linear interpolation of two tensors start and end based on a float or tensor weight.

    If `weight` is a tensor, the shapes of three inputs need to be broadcast;
    If `weight` is a float, the shapes of `input` and `end` need to be broadcast.
    If `weight` is a float and platform is Ascend, the types of `input` and `end` need to be float32.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    .. math::
        output_{i} = input_{i} + weight_{i} * (end_{i} - input_{i})

    Args:
        input (Tensor): The tensor with the starting points. Data type must be float16 or float32.
        end (Tensor): The tensor with the ending points. Data type must be the same as `input`.
        weight (Union[float, Tensor]): The weight for the interpolation formula. Must be a float scalar
            or a tensor with float16 or float32 data type.

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same type and shape as input `input`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input` or `end` is not a tensor.
        TypeError: If `weight` is neither scalar(float) nor tensor.
        TypeError: If dtype of `input` or `end` is neither float16 nor float32.
        TypeError: If dtype of `weight` is neither float16 nor float32 when it is a tensor.
        TypeError: If `input` and `end` have different data types.
        TypeError: If `input`, `end` and `weight` have different data types when `weight` is a tensor.
        ValueError: If `end` could not be broadcast to a tensor with shape of `input`.
        ValueError: If `weight` could not be broadcast to tensors with shapes of `input` and `end` when it is a tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> start = Tensor(np.array([1., 2., 3., 4.]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> end = Tensor(np.array([10., 10., 10., 10.]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = ops.lerp(start, end, 0.5)
        >>> print(output)
        [5.5 6. 6.5 7. ]
