rms_norm_grad:
  description: |
    Calculates the gradient of RmsNorm operation.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Inputs:
        - **dy** (Tensor) - The grad of previous operator, support data type: float16, float32, bfloat16.
        - **x** (Tensor) - Input data of RmsNorm, support data type: float16, float32, bfloat16.
        - **rstd** (Tensor) - The second output of RmsNorm, support data type: float16, float32, bfloat16.
        - **gamma** (Tensor) - Support data type: float16, float32, bfloat16.

    Returns:
        - **dx** (Tensor) - Has the same type and shape as `dy`.
        - **dgamma** (Tensor) - A float32 Tensor with the same shape as `gamma`.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``
