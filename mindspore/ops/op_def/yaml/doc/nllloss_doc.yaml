nllloss:
    description: |
        Gets the negative log likelihood loss between logits and labels.

        The nll loss with :math:`reduction = none` can be described as:
    
        .. math::

            \ell(x, t)=L=\left\{l_{1}, \ldots, l_{N}\right\}^{\top},
            \quad l_{n}=-w_{t_{n}} x_{n, t_{n}},
            \quad w_{c}=\text { weight }[c] \cdot 1
    
        where :math:`x` is the logits, :math:`t` is the labels, :math:`w` is the weight,
        :math:`N` is the batch size, :math:`c` belonging to [0, C-1] is class index,
        where :math:`C` is the number of classes.
    
        If :math:`reduction \neq none` (default ``'mean'`` ), then
    
        .. math::
        
            \ell(x, t)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
            \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{t n}} l_{n}, & \text { if reduction }=\text { 'mean'; } \\
            \sum_{n=1}^{N} l_{n}, & \text { if reduction }=\text { 'sum' }
            \end{array}\right.

            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.
            
        Args:
            reduction (str, optional): Apply specific reduction method to the output: ``'none'`` , ``'mean'`` ,
                ``'sum'`` . Default: ``'mean'`` .
    
                - ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied.
                - ``'mean'``: compute and return the weighted mean of elements in the output.
                - ``'sum'``: the output elements will be summed.
    
            ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
                and does not contribute to the input gradient. Default: ``-100`` .
    
        Inputs:
            - **logits** (Tensor) - Input logits, with shape :math:`(N, C)`. Data type only supports float32 or float16
              or bfloat16(only supported by Atlas A2 training series products).
            - **labels** (Tensor) - Ground truth labels, with shape :math:`(N,)`, where each value belong to
              :math:`[0, C-1]`. Data type only supports uint8 or int32 or int64.
            - **weight** (Tensor) - The rescaling weight to each class, with shape :math:`(C,)` and data type only
              supports float32 or float16 or bfloat16(only supported by Atlas A2 training series products). It should
              have the same data type as `logits` .
    
        Returns:
            Tuple of 2 tensors composed with `loss` and `total_weight`.
    
            - **loss** (Tensor) - When `reduction` is ``'none'`` and `logits` is a 2D tensor,
              the `loss` shape is :math:`(N,)`. Otherwise, the `loss` is a scalar.
              The data type is the same with that of `logits`.
            - **total_weight** (Tensor) - The `total_weight` is a scalar. The data type is the same with that of `weight`.
       
        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
    
        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> logits = Tensor(np.array([[0.5488135, 0.71518934],
            ...                           [0.60276335, 0.5448832],
            ...                           [0.4236548, 0.6458941]]).astype(np.float32))
            >>> labels = Tensor(np.array([0, 0, 0]).astype(np.int32))
            >>> weight = Tensor(np.array([0.3834415, 0.79172504]).astype(np.float32))
            >>> nll_loss = ops.NLLLoss(reduction="mean")
            >>> loss, weight = nll_loss(logits, labels, weight)
            >>> print(loss)
            -0.52507716
            >>> print(weight)
            1.1503246
