        SoftSign activation function.

        The function is shown as follows:

        .. math::
            \text{SoftSign}(x) = \frac{x}{1 + |x|}

            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The input of Softsign.

        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same shape as `input`. The dtype of output is float32 when dtype of `input` is in [bool, int8, uint8, int16, int32, int64]. Otherwise output has the same dtype as `input`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([0, -1, 2, 30, -30]), mindspore.float32)
            >>> output = ops.softsign_ext(x)
            >>> print(output)
