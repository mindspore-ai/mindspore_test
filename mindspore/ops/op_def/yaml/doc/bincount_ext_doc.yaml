bincount_ext:
  description: |
    Count the occurrences of each value in the input.

    If `minlength` is not specified, the length of the output Tensor is the maximum value in the input plus one.
    If `minlength` is specified, the length of the output Tensor is the maximum value between `minlength` or
    the maximum value in the input plus one.

    Each value in the output Tensor represents the number of occurrences of that index value in the input.
    If `weights` is specified, the output results are weighted, 
    i.e., :math:`out[n] += weight[i]` instead of :math:`out[n] += 1`.
    
    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): A one-dimensional Tensor.
        weights (Tensor, optional): Weights with the same shape as the input. Default: ``None``.
        minlength (int, optional): The minimum length of output Tensor. Should be non-negative. Default: ``0``.

    Returns:
        Tensor, If input is non-empty, the output shape is :math:`(max(max(input)+1, minlength), )`,
        otherwise the shape is :math:`(0, )`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input` or `weights` is not a Tensor.
        ValueError: If `input` contains negative values.
        ValueError: If `input` is not one-dimensional or `input` and `weights` do not have the same shape.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> from mindspore import ops, Tensor
        >>> print(ops.auto_generate.bincount_ext(Tensor(np.arange(5))))
        [1 1 1 1 1]
        >>> print(ops.auto_generate.bincount_ext(Tensor(np.array([0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 7]))))
        [1 3 1 1 0 0 0 1]
        >>> w = Tensor(np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.7, 1., -0.6])) # weights
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]))
        >>> print(ops.auto_generate.bincount_ext(x,  weights=w, minlength=5))
        [0.3 0.7 1.1 0.  0. ]
