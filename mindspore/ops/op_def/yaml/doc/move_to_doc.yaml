move_to:
  description: |
    Copy Tensor to target device synchronously or asynchronously, default synchronously. Only support Graph mode.

    Args:
        - src (Tensor) - The input Tensor to be moved.
        - to (str): a string type value, one of ``"Ascend"``, ``"CPU"``.
        - blocking (bool, optional): a bool type value, using synchronous copy or asynchronous copy.
              Default: ``True`` , synchronous copy.

    Returns:
        - dst (Tensor) - New Tensor, storged on target device which with the same type and shape as the `src`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the type of `blocking` is not bool type.
        ValueError: If the value of `to` is not one of ``"Ascend"``, ``"CPU"``.
        ValueError: If the run mode is not Graph mode.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> from mindspore import ops
        >>> x = ms.Tensor([1, 2, 3], ms.int64)
        >>> new_tensor = ops.move_to(x, "CPU")
