        Change the shape of the input tensor based on the shape of other.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The input tensor.
            other (Tensor): The shape of return tensor is same as the shape of other.

        Returns:
            Tensor, which has the same shape of other.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` is not a tensor.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> input = Tensor(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]], dtype=np.float32))
            >>> other = Tensor(np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], dtype=np.float32))
            >>> output = ops.view_as(input, other)
            >>> print(output)
            [[1. 2.]
             [3. 2.]
             [3. 4.]]
