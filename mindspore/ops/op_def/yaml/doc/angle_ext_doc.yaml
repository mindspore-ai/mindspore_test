angle_ext:
    description: |
        Computes the element-wise angle (in radians) of the given input tensor.

        .. math::

            out_i = angle(input_i)

        .. warning::
            - This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.
            - If the data type of `input` is complex, this operator does not support backward derivation.

        Note:
            Angle returns ``Pi`` degree for negative real numbers, zero for non-negative real numbers.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): Input tensor.

        Returns:
            Tensor. If the input type is float16, the return type is also float16. Otherwise, returns float32.
            The returned shape is the same as the input.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: If the dtype of `input` is unsupported, such as float64 or complex128.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
          >>> import mindspore
          >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
          >>> input = Tensor([-1.5 + 7.8j, 3 + 5.75j], mindspore.complex64)
          >>> output = ops.auto_generate.angle_ext(input)
          >>> print(output)
