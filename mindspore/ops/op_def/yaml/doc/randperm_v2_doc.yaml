randperm_v2:
    description: |
        Generates random permutation of integers from 0 to n-1.

        .. warning::
            - This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.
            - The Ascend backend does not support the reproducibility of random numbers, so
              the `seed` parameter has no effect.


        Args:
            n (Union[Tensor, int]): The upper bound (exclusive).
            seed (int, optional): Random seed. Default ``0`` . When seed is -1, offset is 0,
                it's determined by time.
            offset (int, optional): Offset to generate random numbers. Priority is higher than random seed.
                Default ``0`` . It must be non-negative.
            dtype (mindspore.dtype, optional): The data type returned. Default ``mstype.int64``.

        Returns:
            Tensor. Its shape is specified by the required args `n`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> n, seed, offset = 4, 0, 0
            >>> output = mindspore.ops.randperm(n, seed, offset, dtype=mindspore.int64)
            >>> print(output)
            [0 2 1 3]
