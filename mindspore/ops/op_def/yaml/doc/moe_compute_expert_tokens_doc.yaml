moe_compute_expert_tokens:
  description: |
    In MoE calculation, Search for the last index processed by each expert through binary search.

    .. math::
        expert_tokens_{i} = BinarySearch(sorted_experts, num_expert)

    Inputs:
        - **sorted_experts** (Tensor) - A tensor which represent sorted experts, must be 1D tensor.
          Supported type: Int32.
        - **num_expert** (int) - The number of experts, must be greater than 0.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, have the same dtype with sorted_experts.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if `sorted_experts` is not a tensor.
        ValueError: if `num_expert` is less than 0.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> from mindspore.ops.auto_generate import MoeComputeExpertTokens
        >>> sorted_experts = ms.Tensor([0, 0, 1, 2, 2], dtype=ms.int32)
        >>> num_expert = 5
        >>> net = MoeComputeExpertTokens()
        >>> expert_tokens = net(sorted_experts, num_expert)
        >>> print(expert_tokens)
        [2, 3, 5]
