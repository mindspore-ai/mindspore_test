expand_as:
    description: |
        Broadcast the shape of the input tensor to be the same as the another input tensor. The dim of the
        input shape must be smaller than or equal to that of another and the broadcast rules must be met.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The input Tensor.
            other (Tensor): The target Tensor. It's shape is the target shape that input tensor need to be broadcasted.

        Returns:
            Tensor, with the given shape of `other` and the same data type as `input`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `other` is not a tensor.
            ValueError: If the shape of `other` and `input` are incompatible.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor
            >>>  from mindspore.ops.function.array_func import expand_as
            >>> x = Tensor(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]).astype(np.float32))
            >>> other = Tensor(np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]).astype(np.float32))
            >>> output = expand_as(x, other)
            >>> print(output)
            [[1. 2. 3.]
             [1. 2. 3.]
             [1. 2. 3.]]
            >>> shape = (3, 3)
