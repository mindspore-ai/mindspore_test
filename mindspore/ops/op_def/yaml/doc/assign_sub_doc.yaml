assign_sub:
    description: |
        Updates a `Parameter` or `Tensor` by subtracting a value from it.

        Args of `variable` and `value` comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types consistent.
        If they have different data types, the lower priority data type will be converted to
        the relatively highest priority data type.
        If `value` is a number, the number is automatically converted to Tensor,
        and the data type is consistent with the Tensor data type involved in the operation.

        Note:
            Since `variable` is a data type Parameter or Tensor, the data type cannot be changed,
            so only the type of `value` is allowed to be promoted to the type of `variable`.
            And the conversion type supported by different devices will be different,
            it is recommended to use the same data type when using this operator.

        Args:
            variable (Union[Parameter, Tensor]): The `Parameter` or `Tensor`.
                :math:`(N,*)` where :math:`*` means, any number of additional dimensions.
            value (Tensor): The value to be subtracted from the `variable`.
                It must have the same shape as `variable`.
                it is recommended to use the same data type when using this operator.

        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same data type and shape as `variable`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `value` is neither Number nor Tensor.
            RuntimeError: If the type conversion between `variable` and `value` is not supported.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
            >>> from mindspore.common.initializer import initializer
            >>> variable = mindspore.Parameter(initializer(1, [1], mindspore.int32), name="global_step")
            >>> value = Tensor(np.ones([1]).astype(np.int32) * 100)
            >>> ops.assign_sub(variable, value)
            >>> print(variable.asnumpy())
