squeeze:
  description: |
    Return the Tensor after deleting the dimension of size 1 in the specified `axis`.

    Refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.squeeze` for more details.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        axis (Union[int, tuple(int)]): Specifies the dimension indexes of shape to be removed, which will remove
            all the dimensions of size 1 in the given axis parameter. If specified, it must be int32 or int64.
            Default: ``()`` .

    Inputs:
        - **input** (Tensor) - The shape of tensor is :math:`(x_1, x_2, ..., x_R)`.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, the shape of tensor is :math:`(x_1, x_2, ..., x_S)`.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> input = Tensor(np.ones(shape=[3, 2, 1]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> squeeze = ops.Squeeze(2)
        >>> output = squeeze(input)
        >>> print(output)
        [[1. 1.]
         [1. 1.]
         [1. 1.]]
