narrow:
    description: |
        Returns a narrowed tensor from input tensor, and
        the dimension axis is input from start to start + length.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): the tensor to narrow.
            dim (int): the axis along which to narrow.
            start (int): the starting dimension.
            length (int): the distance to the ending dimension.

        Returns:
            output (Tensors) - The narrowed tensor.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If the input is not a tensor or tuple or list of tensors.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> from mindspore import mint
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor
            >>> x = Tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], mindspore.int32)
            >>> output = mint.narrow(x, 0, 0, 2)
            >>> print(output)
            [[ 1 2 3]
             [ 4 5 6]]
            >>> output = mint.narrow(x, 1, 1, 2)
            >>> print(output)
            [[ 2 3]
             [ 5 6]
             [ 8 9]]
