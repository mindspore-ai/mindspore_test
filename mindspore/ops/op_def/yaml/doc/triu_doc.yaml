triu:
    description: |
        Returns the upper triangle part of 'input' (elements that contain the diagonal and below),
        and set the other elements to zeros.

        .. warning::
            This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): The input tensor with shape :math:`(M, N, *)` where * means any number of additional dimensions.
            diagonal (int, optional): An optional attribute indicates the diagonal to consider, default: ``0``,
                indicating the main diagonal.

        Returns:
            Tensor, a tensor has the same shape and data type as input.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `diagonal` is not an int.
            TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.
            ValueError: If the dimension of `input` is less than 2.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
