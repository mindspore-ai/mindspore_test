mean_ext:
    description: |
        Reduces all dimension of a tensor by averaging all elements in the dimension, by default.
        And reduce a dimension of `input` along the specified `dim`. `keepdim`
        determines whether the dimensions of the output and input are the same.

        Note:
            The `dim` with tensor type is only used for compatibility with older versions and is not recommended.

        Args:
            input (Tensor[Number]): The input tensor. The dtype of the tensor to be reduced is number.
                :math:`(N, *)` where :math:`*` means, any number of additional dimensions.
            dim (Union[int, tuple(int), list(int), Tensor]): The dimensions to reduce. Default: ``None`` ,
                reduce all dimensions. Only constant value is allowed. Assume the rank of `input` is r,
                and the value range is [-r,r).
            keepdim (bool): If ``True`` , keep these reduced dimensions and the length is 1.
                If ``False`` , don't keep these dimensions. Default: ``False`` .
            dtype (:class:`mindspore.dtype`): The desired data type of returned Tensor. Default: ``None`` .

        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same data type as input tensor.

            - If `dim` is ``None`` , and `keepdim` is ``False`` ,
              the output is a 0-D tensor representing the product of all elements in the input tensor.
            - If `dim` is int, set as 1, and `keepdim` is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_2, ..., x_R)`.
            - If `dim` is tuple(int), set as (1, 2), and `keepdim` is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_3, ..., x_R)`.
            - If `dim` is 1-D Tensor, set as [1, 2], and `keepdim` is ``False`` ,
              the shape of output is :math:`(x_0, x_3, ..., x_R)`.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If `x` is not a Tensor.
            TypeError: If `dim` is not one of the following: int, tuple, list or Tensor.
            TypeError: If `keepdim` is not a bool.
            ValueError: If `dim` is out of range.
