index_add\_:
    description: |
        Accumulate the elements of `alpha` times `source` into the `self` by adding to the index in the order given in `index`. For example, if ``dim == 0`` , ``index[i] == j`` , and ``alpha = -1`` , then the `i` th row of `source` is subtracted from the `j` th row of `self` . The `dim` th dimension of `source` must have the same size as the length of `index` , and all other dimensions must match `self`, or an error will be raised. For a 3-D tensor the output is defined as follows:

        .. math::
            \begin{array}{ll}
            self[index[i],\ :,\ :]\ +=\ alpha * source[i,\ :,\ :]  \qquad \#if\ dim == 0 \\
            self[:,\ \ index[i],\ :]\ +=\ alpha * source[:,\ \ i,\ :]  \qquad \#if\ dim == 1 \\
            self[:,\ :,\ \ index[i]]\ +=\ alpha * source[:,\ :,\ \ i]  \qquad\#if\ dim == 2 \\
            \end{array}

        Args:
            dim (int): The dimension along which to index.
            index (Tensor): Add the value of "self Tensor" and `source` along the dimension of the `dim` according to the specified index value, with data type int32. The `index` must be 1D with the same size as the size of `source` in the `dim` dimension. The values of `index` should be in [0, b), where the b is the size of "self Tensor" in the `dim` dimension.
            source (Tensor): The input tensor with the value to add. Must have same data type as "self Tensor". The shape must be the same as "self Tensor" except the `dim` th dimension.

        Keyword Args:
            alpha (number, optional): The scalar multiplier for source. Default: ``1``.
            
        Returns:
            Tensor, has the same shape and dtype as "self Tensor".
        
        Raises:
            TypeError: If neither `index` nor `source` is a Tensor.
            ValueError: If the value of `dim` is out of the dimension range of `source` shape.
            ValueError: If `self` rank is not the same as `source` rank.
            ValueError: If shape of `index` is not 1D or size of `index` is not equal to dimension of source[dim].
            ValueError: If the shape of `source` is not the same as that of `self` except the `dim` axis.
